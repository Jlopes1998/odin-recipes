# odin-recipes

This is my first HTML project on The Odin Project. The goal is to create a basic recipe website.

Goals:

1. Create a main index.html file.
2. Create a few recipe pages.
3. Create links to these recipes on the main index.html file.
4. Practice adding and commiting changes to Github using Git.
